## 🎯 Core Features Deep Dive

### 1. Smart Job Discovery Engine

**Algorithm Overview:**
```python
def discover_jobs(keywords, location, max_results=15):
    # 1. Portfolio skill extraction
    user_skills = portfolio.extract_all_skills()

    # 2. Multi-source search aggregation
    sources = [IndeedAPI(), LinkedInPublic(), WebScraping()]
    raw_jobs = []
    for source in sources:
        raw_jobs.extend(source.search(keywords, location))

    # 3. Intelligent deduplication
    unique_jobs = deduplicate_jobs(raw_jobs)

    # 4. Relevance scoring
    scored_jobs = []
    for job in unique_jobs:
        match_score = calculate_match_score(job, user_skills)
        if match_score > 0.3:  # Minimum threshold
            scored_jobs.append({**job, 'match_score': match_score})

    # 5. Sort by relevance and return top results
    return sorted(scored_jobs, key=lambda x: x['match_score'], reverse=True)[:max_results]
```

**Scoring Factors:**
- **Skill Match**: Direct keyword matches (40%)
- **Experience Level**: Years of experience alignment (25%)
- **Tech Stack**: Framework and tool compatibility (20%)
- **Role Relevance**: Job title and description fit (15%)

        'clarity': assess_clarity(email),
        'personalization': measure_personalization(email, company_intel),
        'call_to_action': evaluate_cta_strength(email)
    }

    total_score = sum(metrics.values())
    score_class = classify_score(total_score)

    return {
        'success_score': total_score,
        'key_metrics': metrics,
        'score_class': score_class,
        'strengths': identify_strengths(metrics),
        'improvements': suggest_improvements(metrics)
    }
```

**Score Interpretation:**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Job Discovery Issues

**Problem**: No jobs found
```
Solutions:
1. Use broader keywords: "Python Developer" vs "Python Django Kubernetes"
2. Try different locations: "Remote", "New York", "San Francisco"
3. Check internet connectivity
4. Verify job board accessibility
```

**Problem**: Low match scores
```
Solutions:
1. Update portfolio with more recent projects
2. Add missing skills to portfolio CSV
3. Use more specific search terms
4. Check portfolio CSV formatting
```

#### LLM & API Issues

**Problem**: Rate limit exceeded
```
Solutions:
1. Add delays between requests (implemented)
2. Switch to larger model tier
3. Use OpenAI as fallback
4. Implement request queuing
```

**Problem**: Inconsistent tone detection
```
Solutions:
1. Use manual tone override
2. Provide more context in job description
3. Check for mixed tones in posting
4. Update tone detection prompts
```

#### Portfolio Issues

**Problem**: Skills not extracting properly
```
Solutions:
1. Verify CSV format and encoding
2. Use consistent skill naming
3. Add more descriptive project titles
4. Include skills in description field
```

**Problem**: Vector database errors
```
Solutions:
1. Delete vector_db/ folder
2. Reinitialize: python -c "from app.portfolio import Portfolio; p = Portfolio(); p.load_portfolio()"
3. Check disk space availability
4. Verify ChromaDB installation
```

#### Web Scraping Issues

**Problem**: Job page scraping fails
```
Solutions:
1. Some sites block scraping - use alternative sources
2. Add realistic headers in utils.py
3. Implement retry logic with backoff
4. Use Selenium for JavaScript-heavy sites
```

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:
```bash
export STREAMLIT_DEBUG=True
streamlit run app/main.py --logger.level=debug
```

### Performance Optimization

For slower systems:
```python
# Reduce concurrent operations
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 2

# Use smaller model
self.llm = ChatGroq(model="llama-3.1-8b-instant")

# Disable analytics for speed
ENABLE_ANALYTICS = False
```
